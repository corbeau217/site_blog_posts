## post extensions

### `.html` / themed posts
* currently converted in to cards on the site when it's up and viewable
* these are themed daily posts based on the day they were made
* the format was starting to spiral in to an expectation for success which chased away the original intent of the posts

### `.md` / un-themed posts
* not currently (20250522) converted in to cards for the site
* used for exploring ideas separate from a theme, without cluttering up documentation of other projects
* these may or may not be acted apon in the future, and are mostly intended to get the brain worm somewhere to exist without burying it out of sight
* usually reserved for open source projects and ideas which arent directly dependent on another project
