## unthemed musings
* this post is just to explore an idea separate from another project's documentation/daily notes

## idea 1 - phonetic dictionary sampler system

* for voice over in vlogs and uploaded clips
    * recording phonetic sounds as monotone
        * could then use some sort of autotune to modify the tone/pitch of the samples
* dictionary of phonetic pairings for words as they're used
    * existing engine to manage the sound playing initially
    * built over time with continued use
    * type out the words, manually identify phonetics used until it's automatic later
    * save the phonetic pairings of words to a file for later
* provides security from identity concerns
    * easy to disprove as someone attempting identity theft
        * could intentionally fry/compress the samples after making them, and again before uploading
        * keep master copy of clips safe somewhere encrypted
        * limited samples means it's harder to train models as it will only ever be monotonous / errors
* could open source the project
    * move to manually making the project in c/c++ or something
        * raylib/godot likely
    * crowd source the pairing of phonetics
    * lets people make dictionaries for other languages
    * means a wider range of people to help identify the needed phonetic recordings
        * could be a way to identify if you have the phonetic sounds needed for a language
    * free game voice acting with permission from those willing to share their phonetic sounds
* make it about the phonetic usage/timings dictionary
    * api system? crowd sourced dictionary?
    * then it's just about interpretting the dictionary in a player that can use it
    * players arent language locked and it means that someone else could pick it up and make a better player
